    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have wanted to be a programmer since I was twelve years old. Since then I have pursued that by toying around in game development as a hobby. Recently, I have taken a massive leap towards that dream by taking a course at Eleven Fifty Academy, and now I am looking to take the next step by starting my career. I am ambitious, driven, and an outside-the-box thinker. I hope you will consider me to be the next edition to your team.</p>
